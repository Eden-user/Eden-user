Hi there. Welcome to my den :)
"What are they doing here ?", you may ask, and I shall answer :

*Once upon a time, in a faraway country, there was a philosophy student.* (Bear with me). *Having gone through the hadships known in this country as **Hypokhâgne** and **Khâgne**, they wondered, and wandered, and decided to climb their way out of Plato's cave and see the real words. We shall not describe here all their beautiful discoveries but one, a very surprising one : there's more to a computer than G00gle and Libre0ffice. A whole world opened up before them and they gladly jumped down the rabbit hole. Now here they are, exploring the tunnels, and still realising how vast this underground network ( :p ) is.* 
I could apologise for not providing an ending to this tale, but I am no soothsayer.

I'll try my best to keep the fruit of my roamings updated here, and I'm gladly open to feedback and constructive criticism. 

Let me finish by saying I'm having the time of my life doing beep beep boop on my computer ^^
